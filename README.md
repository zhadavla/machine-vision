I completed a bunch of assignments related to machine vision during the semester, but unfortunately, I wasn't allowed to save them anywhere ðŸ˜¢. In our exercises, we worked in pairs. Each time, we received an assignment where we had to select a suitable camera for a specific scene, capture images, and process them in some way.

Here's a list of assignment topics:

1. Introductory exercise - familiarization with tools
2. Working with cameras in Jupyter Notebook
3. Optical defects, camera calibration
4. Image segmentation
5. Lighting utilization
6. Image perspective
7. Image perspective with 360Â° lenses
8. Line-scan cameras
9. Transformation techniques
10. Working with a depth camera
11. Basics of thermal camera measurements
12. Image classification and object detection

I have some homework assignments available:
